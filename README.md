# TTP x TTT

## Synopsis

This project is a simple two-player Tic Tac To interpretation built using React, and styled with CSS.

## Motivation

This project is for the Tech Talent Pipeline Code Challenge. The instructions are:

```
Please create a version of Tic Tac Toe (TTT) in your language/framework of choice. Feel free to use any tools you prefer. The result should be a GitHub repository (repo), which you should send us a link to. In that repo there should be a file called README.md which should outline the steps to run your program.

Your TTT must have a GUI, but what it is and how that GUI works is up to you (e.g. web browser, iOS, Android). If you want to use the terminal as output using a scripting language, that's totally acceptable. You can build a two-player version or a single-player vs. computer version. The game should be able to determine a winner.

Your code will be judged mainly on its quality as opposed to memory or CPU efficiency.
```
